# Psychfactors
This is my first Git-Rep and it is a collection of various projects featured on www.psychfactors.com. 

My aim is to share my efforts in developing eye-tracked or immersive human-factors-related programs using a range of software/frameworks (including Vizard, Psychopy, Unity, Kinect-SDK, Oculus-SDK). 

Topics: eye-tracking, virtual reality, immersion, psychology, human factors
